# A role is a definition of the permissions for each Kubernetes resource type
# This example is basically readonly for everything
#
# A ClusteRole differs from a Role in that it applies to the entire cluster, thus there 
# is no namespace defined. This example is a ClusterRole
#  
# User Impersonation with kubectl is a good way to test RBAC
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation
# kubectl auth can-i get pods --as dev-ops
# kubectl auth can-i delete pods --as dev-ops
# 
# kubectl describe role dev-ops
